# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

**Privy (Expo Go):** If you use Privy and see "Native app ID `host.exp.Exponent` has not been set as an allowed app identifier", add it in the [Privy Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io): **Configuration → App settings → Clients** → under "Allowed app identifiers" add **`host.exp.Exponent`** for Expo Go.

**Privy OAuth (Google, Apple, X):** Enable the login methods you want in the [Privy Dashboard](https://dashboard.privy.io/apps?page=login-methods&logins=socials) under **Login methods**. Configure [allowed URL schemes](https://docs.privy.io/basics/get-started/dashboard/app-clients#allowed-url-schemes) for your app so OAuth redirects work.

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
