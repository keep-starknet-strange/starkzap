## Key Concepts for Web2 Developers

If you're new to blockchain development, here are the key terms you'll encounter, explained using familiar web2 concepts:

### Wallet

**Web2 Equivalent:** Bank account or user account

A wallet is like a bank account on the blockchain. It has:
- An **address** (like an account number) - where you receive funds
- A **private key** (like a password) - used to authorize transactions
- A **public key** (like a username) - derived from the private key, can be shared

Unlike a bank account, users control their wallet directly—there's no bank in the middle.

### Signer

**Web2 Equivalent:** Authentication/Authorization system

A signer is what proves you own a wallet and authorizes transactions. Think of it like:
- **OAuth tokens** - prove you're logged in
- **API keys** - authorize API calls
- **Digital signatures** - prove you authorized a transaction

The SDK supports different signer types:
- **Private Key Signer** - Like storing a password locally (for servers only)
- **Privy Signer** - Like OAuth, keys managed by a service
- **Cartridge Signer** - Like social login, keys managed by Cartridge

### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

**Web2 Equivalent:** API endpoint

An RPC endpoint is like a REST API endpoint, but for blockchain operations. It's how your app communicates with the blockchain network to:
- Read data (like checking balances)
- Submit transactions (like sending tokens)
- Query the network state

Think of it like calling `fetch()` to a blockchain API instead of your own backend.

### Network / Chain

**Web2 Equivalent:** Environment (production, staging, development)

- **Mainnet** = Production - Real money, real transactions
- **Testnet (Sepolia)** = Staging - Fake money for testing
- **Devnet** = Local development - Your own test blockchain

Just like you have `production`, `staging`, and `localhost` environments.

### Gas / Transaction Fees

**Web2 Equivalent:** Credit card processing fees or API usage costs

Gas is the fee paid to process transactions on the blockchain. Think of it like:
- Credit card processing fees (2-3% per transaction)
- AWS API Gateway costs (pay per request)
- Stripe transaction fees

With the SDK, you can:
- **User pays** - User covers the gas fee (like normal)
- **Sponsored** - You pay the gas fee for users (like offering free shipping)

### Address

**Web2 Equivalent:** Account number, email address, or user ID

An address is a unique identifier for a wallet on the blockchain. It's like:
- A bank account number (where you send money)
- An email address (where you send messages)
- A user ID in your database

Example: `0x04718f5a0fc34cc1af16a1cdee98ffb20c31f5cd61d6ab07201858f4287c938d`

### Private Key

**Web2 Equivalent:** Password or secret key

A private key is a secret that proves you own a wallet. It's like:
- A password for your bank account
- An API secret key
- A JWT signing key

**⚠️ Never share your private key!** It's like sharing your password—anyone with it can control your wallet.

### Public Key

**Web2 Equivalent:** Username or public identifier

A public key is derived from a private key and can be shared. It's like:
- A username (public, can be shared)
- An email address (public identifier)
- A user ID (public reference)

Unlike a private key, sharing your public key is safe.

### Transaction

**Web2 Equivalent:** API request or database operation

A transaction is an operation on the blockchain, like:
- Sending tokens (like a bank transfer)
- Calling a smart contract function (like an API call)
- Deploying a contract (like deploying a service)

Transactions are:
- **Immutable** - Once confirmed, can't be changed (like a database commit)
- **Public** - Anyone can see them (like public API logs)
- **Atomic** - Either fully succeed or fully fail (like database transactions)

### Deploy

**Web2 Equivalent:** Creating an account or provisioning a service

On Starknet, wallets are smart contracts that need to be "deployed" (created on the blockchain) before they can be used. It's like:
- Creating a new user account in your database
- Provisioning a new AWS service
- Setting up a new bank account

The SDK handles this automatically with `deploy: "if_needed"`.

### Token / ERC20

**Web2 Equivalent:** Currency or digital asset

A token is like a currency or digital asset on the blockchain. Think of it like:
- **Bitcoin** - A cryptocurrency
- **USDC** - A stablecoin (like digital dollars)
- **STRK** - Starknet's native token
- **Custom tokens** - Like loyalty points or in-game currency

The SDK makes it easy to send and receive any token, just like sending money via Venmo or PayPal.

### Staking

**Web2 Equivalent:** Savings account or investment

Staking is like putting money in a savings account that earns interest. You:
- Lock up tokens (like depositing money)
- Earn rewards over time (like interest)
- Can withdraw later (like closing the account)

The SDK handles all the complexity—you just call `wallet.enterPool()`.

### Smart Contract

**Web2 Equivalent:** Backend service or API

A smart contract is code that runs on the blockchain. Think of it like:
- A backend API endpoint
- A microservice
- A database stored procedure

Unlike traditional code, smart contracts:
- Run on the blockchain (decentralized)
- Can't be changed once deployed (immutable)
- Execute automatically when called

### Account Preset

**Web2 Equivalent:** Account type or user role

An account preset defines what type of wallet account to create. It's like:
- Choosing between "Personal" vs "Business" account types
- Selecting a user role (admin, user, guest)
- Picking a subscription tier

Different presets have different features and security models (like OpenZeppelin, Argent, Braavos).

## Common Patterns

### Checking a Balance

**Web2 Equivalent:** `SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE user_id = ?`

```typescript
const balance = await wallet.balanceOf(STRK);
// Like: const balance = await db.query('SELECT balance...');
```

### Sending Tokens

**Web2 Equivalent:** `UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - amount WHERE user_id = ?`

```typescript
await wallet.transfer(STRK, [{ to: recipient, amount }]);
// Like: await paymentService.sendMoney(userId, recipientId, amount);
```

### Waiting for Confirmation

**Web2 Equivalent:** Polling an API until a job completes

```typescript
const tx = await wallet.transfer(...);
await tx.wait(); // Wait for blockchain confirmation
// Like: await pollUntilComplete(jobId);
```

## Still Confused?

If you're still unsure about a term, think of it this way:
- **Blockchain** = A distributed database that everyone can read/write
- **Wallet** = A user account on that database
- **Transaction** = A write operation to that database
- **Token** = A number in that database representing value

The SDK abstracts away most of the complexity—you mostly just need to know:
1. Connect a wallet (like logging in)
2. Check balances (like querying a database)
3. Send tokens (like making an API call)
