## Introduction

**Starkzap** enables any application to bring Bitcoin, stablecoins, and DeFi to their users. Built on Starknet's native account abstraction, it provides the tools to integrate wallets, send tokens, enable staking, and execute transactions—without requiring users to manage seed phrases or understand blockchain complexity.

**Quick Start:** Get your first wallet integration working in under 5 minutes with our [Quick Start Guide](/build/consumer-app-sdk/quick-start)

## Protocol Integrations

The SDK includes ready-to-use integrations with major Starknet services:

**Wallet Solutions & Gas Management**
- **Privy** - Like OAuth for wallets: users sign in with email or social accounts, and Privy securely manages their wallet keys on their servers (no seed phrases needed)
- **Cartridge Controller** - Perfect for games: users sign in with Google/Twitter or Face ID/Touch ID, and Cartridge automatically pays all transaction fees so users never see gas costs
- **Argent Account** - Pre-built wallet template you can use (like using a UI component library)
- **Braavos Account** - Another pre-built wallet template option
- **AVNU Paymaster** - Service that pays transaction fees for your users (like offering free shipping—you cover the costs so users don't have to)

**DeFi & Financial Services**
- **Native Staking** - Let users earn passive income by staking tokens (like earning interest on a savings account)
- **Token Operations** - Send and receive tokens, check balances (like handling payments and account balances)
- **Swaps** (incoming) - Let users exchange one token for another (like currency exchange)
- **Borrowing** (incoming) - Enable users to borrow and lend tokens (like a lending platform)
- **Cross-chain Bridge** (incoming) - Enable users to move assets between different blockchains
