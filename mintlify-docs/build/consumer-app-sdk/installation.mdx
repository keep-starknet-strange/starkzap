## Installation

Install Starkzap using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install starkzap
```

or

```bash
yarn add starkzap
```

### Dependencies

The SDK has two peer dependencies:

- [`starknet`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/starknet) (v9+) - Starknet.js core library
- [`@cartridge/controller`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cartridge/controller) - Cartridge wallet integration (optional, only needed for Cartridge support)

These will be installed automatically when you install `starkzap`.

## Next Steps

Once installed, configure the SDK:

1. Set up [Configuration](/build/consumer-app-sdk/configuration) for networks, RPC providers, and optional features
2. Then check out the [Quick Start Guide](/build/consumer-app-sdk/quick-start) to get your first wallet integration working in minutes
